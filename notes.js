/*
  Node.js is a powerful tool for controlling servers, 
building web applications, and creating event-driven
  programs. And it takes JavaScript—a language familiar
to all web developers—out of the browser. With Node.js,
  you can build applications that run on your laptop or 
 even the cloud. In this course, learn the essentials 
of Node.js and start creating your own JavaScript applications. 
 Instructor Eve Porcello covers all of the basics, showing how to
      install Node.js and work with the Node.js core, which includes standard input,
 standard output, the module system, the file system, and how to write and run 
JavaScript on the server. Upon wrapping up this course, 
you’ll be equipped with fundamental Node.js concepts and techniques
that you can put to use in your next project.

Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl, a developer who wanted to build a scalable network application.
Node.js is built on top of the V8 JavaScript engine, which was developed by Google for their Chrome web browser.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
V8 is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. 
It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others. 
It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, 
and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors. V8 can run standalone,
 or can be embedded into any C++ application.


 WebAssembly defines a portable binary-code format and a corresponding text format for
executable programs as well as software interfaces for facilitating interactions between such programs and their host environment
-----------------------------------------------------------------
We are shipping WebAssembly tail calls in V8 v11.2! In this post we give a brief overview of this proposal, demonstrate an interesting use case for C++ 
coroutines with Emscripten, and show how V8 handles tail calls internally.

Core Features of Nodejs
- its event driven
- non-blocking 1/O model

Traditional server-side like PHP , Ruby on Rails use synchronous and blocking 1/) models 
where each request is processed one at a time. Potentially leading to performance hit/bottlenecks.
in high concurrent situations. 

In contrast, node uses an asynchronous, non blocking i/o model
meaning that it can handle multiple connections 
simultaneously and efficiently manage concurrent tasks.

ReactPHP is a low-level library for event-driven programming in PHP. 
At its core is an event loop, on top of which it provides low-level 
utilities, such as: Streams abstraction, async DNS resolver, network 
client/server, HTTP client/server and interaction with processes. 
Third-party libraries can use these components to create async network clients/servers and more.

LARAVEl and other frameworks are asynchronous.
