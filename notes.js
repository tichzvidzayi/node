  Node.js is a powerful tool for controlling servers, 
building web applications, and creating event-driven
  programs. And it takes JavaScript—a language familiar
to all web developers—out of the browser. With Node.js,
  you can build applications that run on your laptop or 
 even the cloud. In this course, learn the essentials 
of Node.js and start creating your own JavaScript applications. 
 Instructor Eve Porcello covers all of the basics, showing how to
      install Node.js and work with the Node.js core, which includes standard input,
 standard output, the module system, the file system, and how to write and run 
JavaScript on the server. Upon wrapping up this course, 
you’ll be equipped with fundamental Node.js concepts and techniques
that you can put to use in your next project.

Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl, a developer who wanted to build a scalable network application.
Node.js is built on top of the V8 JavaScript engine, which was developed by Google for their Chrome web browser.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
V8 is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. 
It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others. 
It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, 
and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors. V8 can run standalone,
 or can be embedded into any C++ application.


 WebAssembly defines a portable binary-code format and a corresponding text format for
executable programs as well as software interfaces for facilitating interactions between such programs and their host environment
