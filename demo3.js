/*

The purpose of setTimeout function is to execute a piece of code after a certain interval of time. The setTimeout() function accepts two arguments. 
The first argument is a function and the second argument is time in milliseconds. 

------------------
The setInterval() method helps us to repeatedly execute a function after a fixed delay.
It returns a unique interval ID which can later be used by the clearInterval() method which stops further repeated execution of the function. 


const intervalId = setInterval(func, 
    [delay, arg1, agr2, ..., argN]);
func is the function that we want to execute repeatedly after delay milliseconds.
delay (optional parameter) is the number of milliseconds delay between 
two repeated execution of the function.
arg1, â€¦, argN (optional parameter) are the arguments that will be passed to func when it is executed
